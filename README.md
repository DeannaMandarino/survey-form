# Survey Form
A responsive survey form created independently using HTML and CSS, following guidelines from the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification course.

## Description

This project showcases a survey form with various input fields, including text, email, age, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a textarea for additional comments. Created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, I completed this project by following specific guidelines while applying my own design choices. It serves as a fun and engaging way to collect information from bridesmaids regarding their participation in the bachelorette.
